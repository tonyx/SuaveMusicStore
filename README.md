# Suave Music Store
Code for sample application written in Suave.IO

Tutorial is available [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/theimowski/suave-music-store)

Note: this version is modified by Tonino Lucca, to run with PostgreSQL 9.6.0 (instead of Microsoft Sql Server/Express)

tested under Mac os X Sierra, Mono 4.6
(you may have to slightly modify the script.sql and DB.fs files)

Note 2: I didn't note, until now, that the official tutorial actually mentions the porting to PostgreSQL, providing specific versions of DB.fs and script.sql targeting PostgreSQL similar (but not identical) to the ones you can find here.
